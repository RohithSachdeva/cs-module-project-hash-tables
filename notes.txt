Building a Hash Table 

Second two days: 
Application of them


Linear search ... #O(n) over the length of the list 
For item in array ... 
     if item == "found" 
     print("You find it")


We need a magic function that will tell us for a given string, which index to look in


["Lorem", "ipsum", etc...]
    0       1       

"amet" -> hash_f() -> 4
"ipsum" -> hash_f() -> 1
