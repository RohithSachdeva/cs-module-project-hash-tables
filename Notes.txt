O(1) lookup

Python dict type is implemented with a hash table

Problem we want to solve:
a = [...]

is a number in the list?

naive O(n) search:
for n in a:
    if n == 9:
    return True..

return False

Build a hash table to make this faster.

What class of problems

What if we could magically just know what slot 9 would be in?  
Hashing function does this

index = magic_index_finder(9) 0(1)
    if a[index] == 9:
        return True
